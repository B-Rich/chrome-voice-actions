Voice Actions for Chrome

This is a Chrom* extnesion that functions similarly to the Google Voice Search app on Android.  It allows users to search the web using speech input and can also interpret certain actions, such as navigating to a particular site.


Note that this extension requires you enable experimental extension APIs.  To do that, follow these steps:
- In your Chrome/Chromium browser, open a tab and navigate to chrome://flags.
- Scroll down to “Experimental Extension APIs” (you may want to just search the page for it (Ctrl+F)).
- Click the “Enable” link.
- A section will appear at the bottom of the page telling you to relaunch Chrome/Chromium.  Save your work in other tabs and click the Relaunch button.
- You should now be able to install the extension.
